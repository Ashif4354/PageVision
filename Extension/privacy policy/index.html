        <h1>Privacy Policy - PageVision</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 13-09-2024</p>
        
        <p>
            At PageVision, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles the information we collect and use.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            PageVision does not collect any personal data, such as your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information. The only data we access is the content of the web pages you visit.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Web Page Content</h2>
        <p>
            Our extension collects the HTML content of the web pages you are visiting. This content is gathered solely for the purpose of querying and processing based on the prompt you provide within the extension.
        </p>
        
        <h2>User Consent</h2>
        <p>
            The extension only accesses the web page content when you explicitly interact with it. We do not passively collect or store data from your browsing activity without your direct action.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>
            The web page content that is collected is used only for querying and processing according to your input. This content is not shared with third parties or used for any purpose beyond the core functionality of the extension.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We prioritize the security of your data and take appropriate measures to ensure that the web page content is handled safely during processing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the extension or other means. The date at the top of this policy will indicate the last update.
        </p>
